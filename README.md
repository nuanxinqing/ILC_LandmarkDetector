ILC_LandmarkDetector
====================

landmark detector training (MATLAB)
This project is used to train landmark detectors using linear SVM and logistic regression.

Given training samples and landmark annotations, features are extracted in PrepareTrainingData.m. Linear SVMs are trained in SVM_Train.m. Finally, logistic.m performs logistic regression on results of linear SVMs.
